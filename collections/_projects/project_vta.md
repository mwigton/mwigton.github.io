Created for the US Navy, The Virtual Training Aid (VTA) is to be used in classrooms to bring more interactive tools to the teachers by allowing 3D models with animations and flow to be navigated by the instructor and students. The VTA Player works by importing a .vta file which contains the model and animations. The .vta file is a renamed asset bundle with a specific architecture. Vta files can be developed by anyone using the developers guide and VTA Content Development project. The main model shown here was used as an example and was not created for this project. The wastegate model was done by myself from photo reference. UI Designs were done by a co-worker, all development was done by myself.
