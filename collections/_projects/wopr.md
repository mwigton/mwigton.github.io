I volunteered at the Cold War Museum and discovered an IBM PC XT in storage. I decided to restore it and create a fun project, an emulation of the computer screens from WarGames.

After getting the hardware running, I installed DOS 2.0 from original 5¼″ floppies I found on eBay. Using the OpenWatcom compiler and Vim, I wrote C code on my modern PC and transferred it to the XT using a custom floppy setup.

The project was a great deep dive into retro hardware and low-level programming. The restored IBM PC XT is now on display at the museum’s second floor, and the full source is available on my GitHub.
